# Data Labeling System for AGENT Platform

## Overview

This directory contains the data labeling components and tools used in the Adaptive Genomic and Electronic Network Therapeutics (AGENT) platform. The labeling system enables annotation and classification of multi-omics data for use in federated learning models and clinical decision support.

## Components

### Annotation Tools

- **Genomic Variant Labeler**: Tools for labeling genomic variants with clinical significance
- **Imaging Annotation**: Radiomics feature labeling and segmentation tools
- **Proteomics Classifier**: Tools for protein expression pattern classification

### Integration with Redox

The labeling system integrates with Redox for secure access to clinical data while maintaining appropriate data governance and privacy controls.

### Quality Control

- **Consensus Labeling**: Multi-reviewer consensus protocols
- **Label Validation**: Statistical validation of labels for model training
- **Version Control**: Tracking of label versions and changes over time

## Usage

To use the labeling tools:

1. Set up appropriate permissions in the authentication system
2. Navigate to the relevant dataset in the AGENT platform
3. Select the appropriate labeling tool based on data type
4. Follow annotation guidelines for consistent labeling
5. Submit labeled data for quality review

## Technical Implementation

The labeling system is built using React components with server-side processing for computational intensive tasks. Data is stored in a structured format compatible with the federated learning framework.

## Security Considerations

All labeling activities are logged and audited to ensure compliance with institutional policies and regulatory requirements. Data access is controlled based on user roles and permissions.
